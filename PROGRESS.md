# Progress

Weekly milestone tracker against the 26-week schedule. Update this every Sunday
(per the plan's weekly execution checklist): what shipped, what's blocked, what the
decision-gate signal says.

## Week 1: Intent Engine Scaffolding + Simulator Proof-of-Concept

**Spec goal:** CLI that takes a business decision as text + context, outputs a
structured risk audit in <10s, tested on 5 example decisions.

**Status:** Done.

- [x] Repo scaffolded (core/simulator/voice module split, tests, docs)
- [x] Git initialized
- [x] Intent classification stage (Claude tool use → `StructuredIntent`)
- [x] Outcome simulation / risk audit stage (Claude tool use → `RiskAudit`)
- [x] `premortem` CLI
- [x] 5 test business decisions written as fixtures
- [x] Unit tests (mocked, no API calls) passing
- [x] Live e2e run against real API on all 5 decisions — **6.8-9.4s each, avg 8.1s, all under the 10s budget**
- [x] Manual quality review of the 5 risk audits (`scripts/run_examples.py`) — grounded in
      the actual numbers given (runway math, burn rate, competitive position), not generic
      startup advice

**Notes / deviations from spec:**
- Two-stage design (separate intent-classification and risk-audit Claude calls, Sonnet)
  was built first but measured at 21-23s end-to-end — over 2x the spec's <10s budget, driven
  by Sonnet writing long-form risk-audit content regardless of "be concise" prompting.
  Replaced the simulator's live pipeline with a **single combined call** (`simulator/analysis.py`,
  `PremortemAnalyzer`) on Haiku 4.5 with a flattened schema (parallel arrays instead of
  nested objects — Haiku returned malformed output on the nested-object version). This
  gets end-to-end latency to ~7-8s. `core/classifier.IntentClassifier` and
  `simulator/outcome_simulation.RiskAuditGenerator` are kept as separate, tested, reusable
  Stage classes for cases without this latency constraint (e.g. a future voice-assistant
  path) — they're just not on the simulator CLI's hot path anymore.
- Skipped Week 1's optional LoRA fine-tuning learning exercise — not required for the
  CLI to work, can revisit if classification quality needs it.
- Business context fields (revenue, growth_rate) are free text, not strict numeric
  types, to avoid guessing units/formats this early.
- Fixed a truncation bug along the way: `max_tokens=1536` was too low for Sonnet's
  original 5-failure-mode output, causing `pydantic.ValidationError` on the last field
  written. `LLMClient.call_tool` now raises a clear error on `stop_reason == "max_tokens"`
  instead of a confusing downstream validation error.

## Week 2+

Not started.
